Hello,

I have a background in computer graphics, physics and art, and I love all things tech.   I am embarking on a self-learning journey in Machine Learning.    To me, teaching an inanimate object like a computer to do things that I am too lazy to do sounds intriguing.  It will be quite the journey, but I feel I need to be prepared for when our digital overlords take over once they achieve singularity.

Follow me on my machine learning journey into the unknown as I try to wrap my head around the science behind developing cognition in machines.

I love discussing all things ML, computer graphics, art, drawing, painting and cycling.

If you like what you see are interested in collaborating, feel free to drop me an email at <mvmuir@hotmail.com> or reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MichaelMuir_).

You can also check out my professional resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eEmPFYLKTsXMDtWi5V1D4Cks6kEmI3L8/view?usp=sharing).

Cheers.
