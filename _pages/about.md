Hello,

I have a background in computer graphics, physics and art, and I love all things tech.   I am embarking on a self-learning journey in Machine Learning.    To me, teaching an inanimate object like a computer to do things I am too lazy to do sounds intriguing.  It will be quite the journey, but I feel I need to be prepared to submit to our digital overlords once they hit singilarity.

Follow me on my machine learning journey into the unkown as I try to wrap my head around the science behind developing cognition in machines.

I love discussiong all things ML, computer graphics, and cycling.

If you like what you see are interested in collaborating, feel free to drop me an email at <mvmuir@gmail.com> or reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MichaelMuir_).

Cheers.
